# Low Number Poission Statistics and Errors

This notebooks shows how to deal with assymetric poission noise at low number statistics. Generally poission errors are $\sqrt N$, where N is the total number of observations. However, it is to be noted that this is true for large N!. For small N (<100 counts), the poission distribution is skewed and assymetric, thus the possion noise will be assymetric in nature. We explore and caculate the assymetric noise here using percentile statsitics.
